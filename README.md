## **Democratizing Knowledge: A tool for cheapskates to access "educational" materials.**

 > Are you ***Indonesian***?[^1]  
 > And you're *frustrated* by the "restrictions" imposed by educational services in the likes of <!-- Ruang*uru --> <span style="filter:blur(1px)">Ruangg\*ru</span> and <!-- Ze*ius --> <span style="filter:blur(1px)">Z\*nius</span>?  

### Introducing, the "new" way to ~~cheat~~ *"ease"* the system, **RGPloit**.
A Google Chrome[^2] extension to "regain" access to these resources.

----

## **Features:**
- ### **Roboguru**
  As roboguru has begun limiting access to resources by requiring logins[^3], a more "sustainable" form of access must be *developed*. Therefore, this ~~bypass~~ *"access method"* is developed.  

  *Just press the button and no more login is needed!* ðŸŽ‰
- ### **Zenbot**
  The new login requirement by zenbot is preventing access to resources that needs to be publicly available.[^4] This allows you to access them without needing to login.  

  *Same thing, press the button, have fun!* ðŸŽ‰

[^1]: For now we're `indonesian-services-only`, but if you're interested in getting support for a specific platform, it must have its solutions be hidden within the HTML.  
As in, it must already be loaded, just hidden under a `div` or something. (This is a requirement until me/someone else *\*wink wink\** adds support for request-level bypasses for that platform.)
[^2]: Just Chrome, *for now. \*wink\**
[^3]: And still restricting access afterwards with ads for non-premium users until a limit quota is reached, after which you can't even do anything anymore.
[^4]: Not to mention that some extensions prevent you from logging in using external accounts (i.e. Google account, etc.) on their login page.
